##  What is Radio Garden Enhanced?

Radio Garden Enhanced is a reimagined version of the original Radio Garden platform that lets you explore live radio stations from around the world through an interactive globe interface. Our enhancement introduces the **"Discover & Stream"** feature, making global radio discovery more personal, local and connected to the way you already listen to music.

Spin the globe, discover a station in Tokyo, Lagos, or São Paulo  and instantly save the songs you love to Spotify.

##  Why It Matters

**The Problem:**
- Millions of live radio stations exist worldwide but discovering them is difficult
- Users want personalized recommendations based on location and trends
- There's a disconnect between discovering music on radio and streaming it later
- Radio Garden (launched 2016) remains relatively unknown despite being fully functional

**Our Solution:**
The "Discover & Stream" feature bridges the gap between radio discovery and modern music streaming by:
- Recommending nearby and trending stations based on your location
- Integrating directly with Spotify so you can save, explore and revisit songs
- Making global radio feel personal and relevant to your listening habits
